# Ripple effect using three.js 

## Description

This is the result of following the tutorial from [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZUdGqeOD0w&t=8s) on how to create a ripple effect.

## How to run
All you have to do is build a vite project using react and typescript and replace the files in the src folder with the ones in this repository.

```bash
src/
  App.tsx
  Main.tsx
```

Then you can empty out the rest of the files in the src folder and run the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Also ensure you install three.js using the following command:

```bash
npm install three
```

This should run the project on your local machine.
